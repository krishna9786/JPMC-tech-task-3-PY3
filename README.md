JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering virtual internship task -3

I am doing virtual internship on JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering for that purpose i created this repo and i am going to share how finsish my task that was given by JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering

before going to task i like to share how i get this internship.

I get the internship on this website insidesherpa <a href="https://www.insidesherpa.com/"> click here</a>
other than JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering lot's of company offer free virtual internship including Microsoft,......

This repo for the task 3<br/>

<h1>Task2 </h1>
<p>
Here is the background information on our task
Being able to access and  adjust data feeds is critical to any trading analysis and stock price monitoring. From the previous tasks, we now have the adjusted data set up on your systems and being piped into Perspective.
</p>
<p>
For traders to have a complete picture of all the trading strategies being monitored, several screens typically display an assortment of live and historical data at their workstation.
</p>
<p>
Given there is a lot of information and data being produced at once, visualizing data in a clear manner with UI/UX considerations accounted for is critical to providing traders with the tools to improve their performance.
</p>
<p><br/>
* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required for this task.<br/>

* Being familiar with python scripting language, command line basics, javascript, react and typescript are not required for this task too as you will be guided in this exercise<br/>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
For the third module of this project will need you to accomplish the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies. </li><br/>
 <li>Modify the typescript files in repository to make the web application behave in the expected manner</li><br/>
 <li>Generate a patch file of the changes you made.</li><br/>
</ol>

<h1>Step1:Set up your system </h1>

 <p> how to run the code </p>
 <pre>
 python datafeed/server3.py // it start the server
 npm install  // it install the dependency pkg
 npm start  // it start our app
 </pre> 
 <hr>
 
<h1>Step2:Modify the typescript files in repository to make the web application behave in the expected manner</h1>
<p>
 Before fixing the broken Typescript files. we need to know some basic that are </p>
 <ol>
 <li> The file structure of the program </li>
 <pre>
├───datafeed ->which the server3.py and test(excel file ) 
├───public  ->index.html (our main html code is here the html code generated by a react is insert here while excuting the code )
└───src 
      |--index.tsx ->  this typescript program is responsible for render the whole app
      |--index.css -> this css file for index.tsx  for styling purpose
      |--App.tsx  ->this is the main typescript code 
      |--App.test.js   -> this for testing purpose  
      |--App.css -> css file for our main app.tsx(typescript)
      |--DataStreamer.ts  -> this typescript program is responsible for get data from the server
      |--Graph.tsx  -> this  typescript program is responsible for drawing a graph on the browser
      |--Graph.css  -> this css file for graph.tsx 
</pre>

<p>There are two things we have to achieve here to complete this task</p>
<ol>
<li>We now want to make this graph more useful to traders by making it
track the ratio between two stocks over time and NOT the two stocks’
  top_ask_price over time.</li><br/>
<li>As mentioned before, traders want to monitor the ratio of two stocks
against a historical correlation with upper and lower thresholds/bounds.
This can help them determine a trading opportunity.That said, we also want
to make this graph plot those upper and lower thresholds and show when
they get crossed by the ratio of the stock </li><br/>
</ol>
<p>To achieve this we have to change (2) files</p><br/>
1.src/Graph.tsx <br/>
2.src/DataManipulator.ts<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Making changes in `App.tsx`</h3>
<p>
● App.tsx is the main app (typescript) file of our client side react application.
 <br/><br/>
● To accomplish our first objective, we must first make changes to the
`Graph.tsx` file. Recall, this is the file that takes care of how the Graph
component of our App will be rendered and react to the state changes that
occur within the App.
<br/><br/>
● We’re not starting from a static graph anymore and we’re basically jumping off
from where we’ve finished in task 2. So the changes we’ll be making here
aren’t going to be as much. What we want to do here is to have one main line
tracking the ratio of two stocks and be able to plot upper and lower bounds
too.
<br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
To do this, we need to modify `componentDidMount` method. Recall, the
componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been
rendered to the DOM.
 <br/><br/>
● In this method, we first have to modify the schema object as that will dictate
how we’ll be able to configure the Perspective table view of our graph.
<br/><br/>
