<h1>Task2 </h1>
<p>
Here is the background information on our task
Being able to access and  adjust data feeds is critical to any trading analysis and stock price monitoring. From the previous tasks, we now have the adjusted data set up on your systems and being piped into Perspective.
</p>
<p>
For traders to have a complete picture of all the trading strategies being monitored, several screens typically display an assortment of live and historical data at their workstation.
</p>
<p>
Given there is a lot of information and data being produced at once, visualizing data in a clear manner with UI/UX considerations accounted for is critical to providing traders with the tools to improve their performance.
</p>
<p><br/>
* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required for this task.<br/>

* Being familiar with python scripting language, command line basics, javascript, react and typescript are not required for this task too as you will be guided in this exercise<br/>

 <p> how to run the code </p>
 <pre>
 python datafeed/server3.py // it start the server
 npm install  // it install the dependency pkg
 npm start  // it start our app
 </pre> 
 <hr>
 
<h1>Step2:Modify the typescript files in repository to make the web application behave in the expected manner</h1>
<p>
 Before fixing the broken Typescript files. we need to know some basic that are </p>
 <ol>
 <li> The file structure of the program </li>
 <pre>
├───datafeed ->which the server3.py and test(excel file ) 
├───public  ->index.html (our main html code is here the html code generated by a react is insert here while excuting the code )
└───src 
      |--index.tsx ->  this typescript program is responsible for render the whole app
      |--index.css -> this css file for index.tsx  for styling purpose
      |--App.tsx  ->this is the main typescript code 
      |--App.test.js   -> this for testing purpose  
      |--App.css -> css file for our main app.tsx(typescript)
      |--DataStreamer.ts  -> this typescript program is responsible for get data from the server
      |--Graph.tsx  -> this  typescript program is responsible for drawing a graph on the browser
      |--Graph.css  -> this css file for graph.tsx 
</pre>

<p>The above codes are work fine but we need to modify the code such that it show the top_ask price from the two stocks("ABC","DEF") in graph
and need to uppdate the graph according to the data get from the server 
</p>
